# ERC 865

As a user new to crypto, when you try to transfer Ethereum-based token, you suddenly find that you need to pay miner fees in Ether. It increases friction for you.

Some of you more familiar with Ethereum might realize that buying gas with anything other than ether could be very detrimental to the network. Ethereum was set up in some very specific ways, and a core tenet of the ecosystem is the requirement gas be bought with only ether.

Don’t fret Ethereum enthusiasts! The requirement that gas is bought with only ether is not going anywhere. ERC-865 just gives the appearance that tokens are used to buy gas, but there’s really more going on behind the scenes.
Among ERC standards developers in the Ethereum community has proposed, ERC 865 intends to make it easy for new crypto users. It proposes using the token to pay the miner fees as well. It’s a draft proposal, and you can read it in the 
[EIP 865 GitHub document](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/865) .
